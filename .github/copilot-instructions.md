<!-- Maze Path Finder Web Project Instructions -->

This is a Discrete Mathematics web project that demonstrates graph theory and DFS algorithm implementation.

## Project Overview
- **Title**: 🧠 Maze Path Finder – A Discrete Mathematics Web Project
- **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS (Grid/Flexbox), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Algorithm**: Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready static files

## Key Features
- Interactive grid-based maze creation
- Visual DFS pathfinding algorithm
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Educational focus on graph theory concepts

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main application page
